# Running ViroMatch

There are two general ways to interact with the ViroMatch image using Docker: 1) as an interactive session; 2) command line execution. Both approaches will produce the same results and preference is up to the user. We will focus on the command line approach for the majority of this documentation, as this method allows for long-running jobs without having to keep an interactive session running on your system.
